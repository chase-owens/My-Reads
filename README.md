# My Reads

My Reads is a digital bookshelf built with React.
---

## Project Overview
This is project 6/7 in Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program. It's all about React. And server requests and updates.

The project offers a [starter repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

But this this project was built from scratch, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It was also beautified with [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io).

## How to Run the app

1. Clone the repository or download the zipped file
2. Open terminal and check to see if [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed
```
node -v
```
  2a. If Node isn't installed, download it (here)[https://nodejs.org/en/]
3. If Node is installed, then open the terminal and navigate to the cloned/downloaded directory and enter
```
npm start
```
and a browser will automatically pop-up.

## Using the app

The arrow on each book opens a dropdown menu that allows users to change shelves of the book or remove the book from the shelf completely. The '+' button in the bottom right opens a search page, where users can search for more books to add to the bookshelf.
